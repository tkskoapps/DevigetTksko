## Assignment
Your assignment is to create a simple Reddit client that shows the top 50 entries from Reddit - www.reddit.com/top

## Show your work

1.  Create a Public repository
2.  Commit each step of your process so we can follow your thought process.

## Guidelines:
    - Assume latest Android platform
    - Support Landscape

## What to show
The app should be able to show data from each entry such as:

    - Title (at its full length, so take this into account when sizing your cells)
    - Author
    - entry date, following a format like “x hours ago” 
    - A thumbnail for those who have a picture.
    - Number of comments
    - Unread status

In addition, for those having a picture (besides the thumbnail), please allow the user to tap on the thumbnail to be sent to the full sized picture. Opening the URL would be OK.

## What to Include

    - Pull to Refresh
    - Pagination support
    - Saving pictures in the picture gallery
    - App state-preservation/restoration
    - Indicator of unread/read post (updated status, after post it’s selected)
    - Dismiss Post Button (remove the cell from list. Animations required)
    - Dismiss All Button (remove all posts. Animations required)
    - Support split layout (left side: all posts / right side: detail post)
