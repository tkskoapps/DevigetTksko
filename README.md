## Assignment
Your assignment is to create a simple Reddit client that shows the top 50 entries from Reddit - www.reddit.com/top

## Show your work

1.  Create a Public repository
2.  Commit each step of your process so we can follow your thought process.

## Guidelines:
    - Assume latest Android platform
    - Support Landscape

## What to show
The app should be able to show data from each entry such as:

    - Title (at its full length, so take this into account when sizing your cells)
    - Author
    - entry date, following a format like “x hours ago” 
    - A thumbnail for those who have a picture.
    - Number of comments
    - Unread status

In addition, for those having a picture (besides the thumbnail), please allow the user to tap on the thumbnail to be sent to the full sized picture. Opening the URL would be OK.

## What to Include

    - Pull to Refresh
    - Pagination support
    - Saving pictures in the picture gallery
    - App state-preservation/restoration
    - Indicator of unread/read post (updated status, after post it’s selected)
    - Dismiss Post Button (remove the cell from list. Animations required)
    - Dismiss All Button (remove all posts. Animations required)
    - Support split layout (left side: all posts / right side: detail post)

## Resources

    - [Reddit API](http://www.reddit.com/dev/api)
    - [Apigee](https://apigee.com/console/reddit)
    - Example JSON file (top.json) is listed.
    - Example Video of functionality is attached
    
## Time Spent
You do not need to fully complete the challenge. We suggest not to spend more than 5 hours total, which can be done over the course of 2 days.  Please make commits as often as possible so we can see the time you spent and please do not make one commit.  We will evaluate the code and time spent.
 
What we want to see is how well you handle yourself given the time you spend on the problem, how you think, and how you prioritize when time is insufficient to solve everything.

Please email your solution as soon as you have completed the challenge or the time is up.
