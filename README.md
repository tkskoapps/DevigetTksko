# Android

## Assignment
Your assignment is to create a simple Reddit client that shows the top 50 entries from Reddit - www.reddit.com/top

## Show your work

1.  Create a Public repository
2.  Commit each step of your process so we can follow your thought process.

## Guidelines:
    - Assume latest Android platform
    - Support Landscape

## What to show
The app should be able to show data from each entry such as:

    - Title (at its full length, so take this into account when sizing your cells)
    - Author
    - entry date, following a format like “x hours ago” 
    - A thumbnail for those who have a picture.
    - Number of comments

In addition, for those having a picture (besides the thumbnail), please allow the user to tap on the thumbnail to be sent to the full sized picture (so just opening the URL would be OK).

## Support
    - Pagination support (10 items per page)
    - Saving pictures in the picture gallery 
    - allow the user to tap on the thumbnail to be sent to the full sized picture.  Opening in the URL is ok too.
    - App state preservation/restoration
